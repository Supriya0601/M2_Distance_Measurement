# M2_Distance_Measurement
Nowadays, we have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation of manual error. Manual distance measuring is always done at the expense of human error. Precise and fix measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this project. This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to 4m with the accuracy of1cm. This project is used measure the distance by using ultrasonic sensors. It works by transmitting ultrasonic waves at 40 kHz. Circuit that have been programmed with AT mega microcontroller 328P. The distance then will be display on a LCD module. The importance of the project is calculating accurate distance from any obstacle that we want to measure. The device can be used in many different fields and categories like distance calculation in construction field, robots, car sensor to avoid obstacles and many other applications.
